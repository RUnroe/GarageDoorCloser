# PROTEC - A - GARAGE
## High School PLTW Engineering Project ##


## DESCRIPTION ##
  Through the touch screen, the user is able to configure when they would like to ensure their garage door is closed. The user can set the garage to close x minutes after it was opened or to close at a specified time. Both of these functions are individually toggleable and easily configurable. The data is then sent to a website to allow the user to monitor the state of the garage door, the times the garage is set to close at, and every time the garage  was opened or closed. This project spanned from August 2018 to April 2019 and was fully documented along the way. Protec-a-Garage runs in parallel to all existing garage door openers and follows all of the same safety features of the garage door.  

## WHAT I LEARNED ##
  There were many things I had to learn to complete this project. I started by learning what a Raspberry Pi was and how to use a linux operating system. After that I had to figure out what language would be the best to create a User Interface in. I found that Python seemed the best, so I learned how to code in Python. I also learned how to download the TKInter Python package through the bash terminal and import it into my program. 
  A few weeks later PHP was introduced to me. I taught myself how to use this to write data to JSON files. This was used to display the data on the website. 

## Data File ##
data.txt file structure located on Raspberry Pi
This is used to retain the users previous settings if the program were to shut off.

1: index of timeout
2: index of setHour
3: index of setMinute
4: index of SetAMPM
